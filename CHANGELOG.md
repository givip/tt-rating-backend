# Changelog

All notable changes to tt-rating-core are documented here.

The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed — schema tidy-up (2026-04-24)

- Dropped dead provenance columns from `players`: `rating_source`, `source_rating`, `source_url`, `import_date`. The `RatingSource` enum is removed entirely. The import seeded `internal_rating` once; nothing else read these columns.
- Added `updated_at DateTime @updatedAt` to `users`, `players`, `clubs`, `tournaments`, `tournament_participants`, `matches`, `rating_changes`. Prisma maintains the column on every update — no application code changes needed. Audit-only tables (`rating_snapshots`, `auth_otps`, `login_attempts`, `refresh_tokens`) intentionally skipped; `rating_config` already had one.
- Added `phone_verified_at DateTime?` and `email_verified_at DateTime?` to `users`. Nullable timestamps double as "is verified" + audit trail. No backfill — pre-existing users stay `NULL` until they re-verify.
- Added `address String?` and `phone String?` to `clubs`.
- Migration hand-edit: `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` was added to each new `updated_at NOT NULL` column so the ALTER backfills existing rows safely. `@updatedAt` continues to drive the column at the ORM layer; the DB default is a belt-and-braces for raw-SQL writes.

### Breaking — admin CSV import

- `AdminService.parseCsvRow` no longer accepts a `source` column in the CSV. Importers must drop the column from their feeds. No migration path — the column was schema-layer-only.

### Added — Casual matches (2026-04-24)

- Endpoints under `/casual-matches`: `POST /` (propose), `GET /pending`, `POST /:id/accept`, `POST /:id/reject`, `DELETE /:id`; plus public `GET /players/:id/casual-matches` for history.
- Two-sided accept flow: a non-provisional proposer (`tournamentsPlayed ≥ 5`) creates a pending match; opponent has 7 days to accept or reject. Accept immediately triggers a per-match rating job.
- `RatingConfig.casual_weight_multiplier` (default `0.3`) — tunes how much casual matches move ratings relative to tournament matches. Final `matchWeight` = tournament set-count weight (bo5) × multiplier; stored on the row at creation so later tuning doesn't rewrite history.
- `processCasualMatch(matchId, prisma)` in the rating-job worker: one Glicko step per player, Postgres advisory locks on both player IDs in sorted order, idempotent via status transition `confirmed → completed` inside the same transaction.

### Changed — BREAKING: `RatingJobTrigger` signature

- `RatingJobTrigger.trigger` now takes `{ tournamentId?: string; matchId?: string }` (exactly one required) instead of a bare `tournamentId: string`. Platform repos with custom adapters must update. The Cloud Run adapter in the ttr.ge platform repo dispatches `TOURNAMENT_ID` or `MATCH_ID` env vars accordingly.

### Changed — schema (casual matches)

- `MatchStatus` enum gains `pending_opponent`, `confirmed`, `rejected`, `expired`.
- `RatingChangeType` enum gains `casual`.
- `Match.tournamentId` is now nullable; new `matchType`, `proposerId`, `confirmedAt`, `expiresAt` columns. Casual rows carry `tournamentId = null`.
- `Match.tournament_id` FK explicitly set to `ON DELETE RESTRICT` (prior auto-generated `ON DELETE SET NULL` would have orphaned tournament matches).
- New composite indexes `(player1Id, matchType, status)` and `(player2Id, matchType, status)` for pending-match queries.

### Added — Pluggable auth (Phase 1)

- `AuthStrategy` interface (`apps/api/src/auth/strategies/auth-strategy.interface.ts`) — strategies implement `name`, optional `initiate` (for multi-step flows like OTP), and `complete` (returns `{ userId, role }` or throws `UnauthorizedException`).
- `PasswordStrategy` — bcrypt with a minimum cost floor of 12. Timing-safe miss path uses a fixed `DUMMY_HASH` so attackers can't distinguish "user doesn't exist" from "wrong password" by response time.
- `PhoneOtpStrategy` — DB-backed 6-digit OTP stored as sha256 hex with a 5-minute TTL. Uses a pluggable `SmsProvider` (`ConsoleSmsProvider` logs to stdout in dev).
- `TokenService` — JWT access tokens (15m default) + 32-byte random refresh tokens stored in DB as sha256 hex. Refresh rotation is atomic (`Serializable` isolation + `updateMany` claim). Reuse of a revoked token revokes the entire chain for that user.
- `RateLimitService` — sliding-window DB-backed rate limit on login attempts (5 failures / 15 minutes per identifier). Records `LoginAttempt` rows.
- `AuthController` routes: `POST /auth/{initiate,login,refresh,logout}`. Strategy selection via `AUTH_STRATEGY` env var.
- Schema: `RefreshToken`, `AuthOtp`, `LoginAttempt` models; `User.email` and `User.passwordHash` columns; `User.phone` made optional.
- Seed: admin user `admin@ttr.ge` with bcrypt-hashed dev password `dev-admin-password` (rotate before production).

### Changed — BREAKING: auth environment variables

- **Removed:** `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` — refresh tokens are now opaque random strings stored (hashed) in the DB; no HMAC is needed.
- **Added:**
  - `AUTH_STRATEGY` (`password` | `phone-otp`, default `password`)
  - `AUTH_ACCESS_TTL` (e.g. `15m`, default `15m`)
  - `AUTH_REFRESH_TTL` (e.g. `30d`, default `30d`)
  - `AUTH_BCRYPT_COST` (min enforced at 12, default 12)
- **Kept:** `JWT_SECRET` — required in production; the service fails to boot if unset with `NODE_ENV=production`.

### Migration

Existing users created before this change have `passwordHash = NULL` and cannot log in via `PasswordStrategy` until a password is set. For self-hosters coming from a pre-auth build: either reseed, or add a one-off script that sets a hashed password per user.

### Fixed

- Refresh-token reuse detection no longer has its chain-wide revocation rolled back by the `UnauthorizedException` thrown at the end of the same transaction. See [docs/auth.md](docs/auth.md) for the full rationale.
